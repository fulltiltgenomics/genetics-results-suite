# genetics-results-suite - Project specification

## Introduction

genetics-results-suite is the Terraform and Kubernetes deployment configuration for the genetics results platform. It orchestrates multiple microservices behind a single GKE Ingress with Google-managed SSL certificates and OAuth2-based authentication.

## Architecture

```
Internet → GKE Ingress (HTTPS, Google-managed certs)
           ├── auth.<domain> → auth-gateway → keycloak (identity broker, login UI + OIDC)
           └── /*  → auth-gateway (nginx, port 8080)
                     ├── /oauth2/*  → oauth2-proxy (OIDC → Keycloak, port 4180)
                     ├── /api/*     → results-api  (FastAPI, port 4000) — oauth2 or bearer token
                     ├── /chat/*    → chat-backend  (FastAPI, port 8000)
                     ├── /mcp/*     → mcp-server    (MCP streamable HTTP, port 8080) — bearer token auth
                     └── /*         → frontend      (nginx, port 3000)

Login flow: oauth2-proxy → Keycloak (genetics realm) → Google or Apple IdP.

Internal only (ClusterIP + NetworkPolicy):
  ├── db-api            (BigQuery proxy, port 8080) — only accessible from chat-backend
  ├── rag-service       (RAG retrieval, port 8000)  — only accessible from chat-backend + mcp-server
  ├── keycloak          (identity broker, port 8080) — reached via auth.<domain>
  └── keycloak-postgres (Keycloak DB, port 5432)     — backed up daily to GCS
```

### results-api deployment tuning

`k8s/deployments/results-api.yaml` sets two env vars that bound the resources its
range-query path (in-process bgzf/tabix reads over GCS) consumes; both have safe
in-code defaults, so they are tuning knobs, not requirements:

| Env var | Value (manifest) | Default in code | Purpose |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| `TABIX_FILTER_WORKERS` | `2` | `min(4, cpu-1)` | Size of the decompress/filter `ProcessPoolExecutor`. The default reads `os.cpu_count()` (host cores, **not** the cgroup CPU quota), so on a large node an unbounded count would spawn many idle, FD-holding workers. Set to match the container's CPU limit (currently `2`). |
| `GCS_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `128` | `128` | Process-wide cap on concurrent GCS range-fetch sockets. A single all-resources variant batch fans out across ~12-15 data files; without a cap the simultaneously-open sockets exhausted the file-descriptor limit ("Too many open files"). Lower if the pod's `NOFILE` limit is tight, raise for more fetch parallelism. |

The container entrypoint (`genetics-results-api`'s `start.sh`) also raises `ulimit -n`
to 65536 as defense-in-depth. Keep `TABIX_FILTER_WORKERS` in step with the deployment's
CPU `limits` if you change them.

## Shared Dataset Configuration

`configs/datasets.yaml` is the single source of truth for dataset and resource definitions consumed by both results-api and db-api. At deploy time, `deploy.sh` creates a Kubernetes ConfigMap (`datasets-config`) from this file and volume-mounts it into both service pods at `/app/configs/datasets.yaml`. Each service reads the path from the `DATASETS_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

For local development, `scripts/sync-datasets.sh` copies the canonical file to sibling service repos so they can run standalone. Each service's YAML loader defaults to `./configs/datasets.yaml` when `DATASETS_CONFIG_PATH` is not set. `deploy.sh` also runs `sync-datasets.sh` (best-effort) before building the ConfigMap, so the committed copies in the sibling repos don't drift from the canonical file. Note that this only keeps `datasets.yaml` in sync — the results-api product configs (`app/config/profiles/*/credible_sets.py`, `summary_stats.py`, `common.py`, etc., which hold the actual GCS file paths and the `dataset_to_resource` map) live only in genetics-results-api and are baked into its image at build time, so changes there require rebuilding and rolling out the results-api image.

Both services load all dataset/resource metadata exclusively from the YAML -- there are no hardcoded fallback dicts. In genetics-results-api, the profile `datasets.py` files are empty placeholders (datasets come from YAML via `app.config.yaml_loader`). The `dataset_to_resource` mapping in `profiles/*/common.py` is still hardcoded as the YAML schema does not yet support exact BQ dataset name to (resource, version) tuples.

The YAML defines two exome dataset resources with different filtering levels: `genebass_exome` (filtered to p < 1e-4) and `ibd_exome` (resource: `ibd_exome_2026`, containing only exome-wide significant variants at p < 3e-7 plus LD-curated variants at p < 5e-6, with 3 phenotypes: IBD, UC, CD). The `dataset_to_resource_rules` map `IBD_exome_2026` to `ibd_exome_2026` for `exome_variant_results_v` and `gene_burden_results_v` views.

ASM-QTL (allele-specific methylation QTL) data from deCODE is served via both BigQuery (`asm_qtl` table / `asm_qtl_v` view) and the standard sumstats endpoint (`/summary_stats/decode/asmqtl`). Two datasets: `decode_asmqtl_cpg` (CpG methylation, phenotype code `CpG`) and `decode_asmqtl_mds` (MDS methylation, phenotype code `MDS`), both under the `decode` resource. The `dataset_to_resource_rules` map `deCODE%` to `decode` for `asm_qtl_v`.

External GWAS pseudo credible sets (COVID-19 HGI, PGC SCZ, PGC BIP, GP2 Parkinson's, and IIBDGC IBD/UC/CD) live in a single shared file `gs://<bucket>/credible_sets/ext_pseudo/EXT_*_pseudo_credible_sets.*.tsv.gz` referenced by five datasets (`covid_hgi`, `pgc_scz`, `pgc_bip`, `gp2_pd`, `ibd_gwas`). Per-phenotype individual CS files are organized into per-source subdirs `ext_pseudo/individual/<source>/` (e.g. `covid_hgi/`, `pgc_scz/`, `iibdgc/`) so phenotype lookups disambiguate when multiple datasets share the same resource (e.g. `pgc_scz` and `pgc_bip` both belong to resource `pgc`). The `dataset_to_resource_rules` map the combined file's `dataset` column values `COVID19_HGI%`, `PGC`, `GP2`, and `IIBDGC` to resources `covid_hgi`, `pgc`, `gp2`, and `ibd_gwas`. The IIBDGC pseudo CS reuse the existing `ibd_gwas` dataset/resource (the IIBDGC IBD/UC/CD GWAS meta-analysis whose summary statistics are already served); they are not formally fine-mapped, so the `ibd_gwas` dataset carries `pseudo_credible_sets: true`. The results-api dedups range queries by combined-file path (one tabix per shared file) and uses a per-row resource filter (`dataset_to_resource` in each profile's `common.py`) so each resource only sees its own rows — the `dataset` column value must therefore be present in that map (e.g. `IIBDGC → ibd_gwas`) for region/variant credible-set queries to attribute its rows.

## Authentication

- **Keycloak** is the identity broker, **enabled per deployment profile** (`ENABLE_KEYCLOAK` in `deploy.sh`, defaulting on for `daly`, off for `finngen`). When enabled it presents the provider chooser and federates **Google** and **Apple** (Sign in with Apple), exposing one OIDC issuer at `https://${KEYCLOAK_HOST}/realms/genetics`. It runs in-cluster (`k8s/deployments/keycloak.yaml`) behind the auth-gateway on its own host `auth.<domain>` (which must be added to terraform `domains` so the managed cert covers it), backed by an in-cluster Postgres (`keycloak-postgres`) with daily `pg_dump` backups to GCS. The image (`keycloak/`) is the official Keycloak plus a bundled Apple identity-provider extension. Setup, Apple Developer prerequisites, secret rotation and restore are documented in `docs/keycloak-apple-signin.md`.
- **oauth2-proxy** handles browser sessions. Its provider is profile-driven (`OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER`): `oidc` against Keycloak where the broker is enabled (daly), or `google` directly otherwise (finngen). Either way it authorizes against an allow-list: one or more **domains** (`OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS`, comma-separated) **or** specific **addresses** (the `--authenticated-emails-file`). Both lists come from terraform — `oauth_email_domain` (comma-separated, e.g. `broadinstitute.org,finngen.fi`) and `oauth_allowed_emails` (specific addresses, e.g. Apple users on `me.com`/`icloud.com`/`privaterelay.appleid.com`).
- **auth-gateway** (nginx) uses `auth_request` to validate requests against oauth2-proxy before proxying; a separate `server` block routes `auth.<domain>` to Keycloak. The email returned by oauth2-proxy is passed to backends in the `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email` header (the `accounts.google.com:` prefix is legacy and provider-agnostic — backends read only the address after the colon).
- **results-api** also accepts `Authorization: Bearer` tokens (Google Identity Tokens or internal shared secret)
- **mcp-server** is not behind oauth2-proxy; it accepts `Authorization: Bearer` tokens via three paths (parity with results-api): the `MCP_API_KEY` shared secret(s), Google Identity Tokens (JWT validated against `email_verified` plus the configured email/domain allow-list), and per-user API tokens issued via the chat API. NOTE: the bearer JWT path validates **Google** Identity Tokens only — programmatic (non-browser) access for Apple-only identities is a known follow-up.
- **Shared bearer-auth allow-list**: `ALLOWED_EMAILS` and `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` (used for Google Identity Token JWT validation in both results-api and mcp-server) are sourced from a single Kubernetes ConfigMap `bearer-auth-allowed` (manifest: `k8s/configs/bearer-auth-allowed.yaml`), populated from `oauth_allowed_emails`/`oauth_email_domain`, consumed by both deployments via `envFrom: configMapRef` to prevent config drift
- **db-api** is internal-only, protected by NetworkPolicy (no auth needed)
- **Internal calls**: chat-backend authenticates to results-api via `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`
- **External MCP servers**: chat-backend proxies tools from external MCP servers (gnomAD, Open Targets) configured via `EXTERNAL_MCP_SERVERS` secret; `EXTERNAL_MCP_EXCLUDE_TOOLS` excludes specific tools by name (comma-separated)

## Infrastructure

- **GCP Project**: Configured via `project_id` in `terraform/terraform.tfvars`
- **Region**: Configured via `region` in `terraform/terraform.tfvars`
- **GKE Cluster**: Single cluster with Workload Identity for GCP API access
- **Networking**: VPC with private subnet, static IP for ingress
- **SSL**: Google-managed certificates for the domain configured in `terraform/terraform.tfvars`
- **Storage**: 10Gi PVC for chat-backend SQLite databases, file attachments, and tool result downloads; 50Gi PV/PVC for rag-service embedding stores
- **Backups**: Daily GCE disk snapshots of the chat-data PVC (14-day retention, configurable via `snapshot_retention_days`)
- **Terraform state**: Per-profile GCS backends (`daly.tfbackend` → `genetics-results-terraform-daly`, `finngen.tfbackend` → `genetics-results-terraform`); `deploy.sh` auto-selects based on `config_profile`

## Monitoring

### Metrics (Prometheus)

- **Google Managed Prometheus** is enabled on the GKE cluster, collecting system and workload metrics
- Metrics are stored in Cloud Monitoring (Monarch) and queryable via PromQL in Cloud Monitoring or Grafana
- Access metrics via GCP Console → Monitoring → Metrics Explorer (PromQL tab) or by deploying a Grafana instance

### Monitor CronJob

A Python-based monitoring CronJob (`scripts/monitor/`) runs 3x/day (every 8 hours, schedule `0 */8 * * *`) and sends results to Slack. Deployed as a Kubernetes CronJob in the `genetics` namespace.

**What it checks:**

- **Service health** (`health.py`): HTTP liveness checks against results-api `/healthz`, chat-backend `/healthz`, frontend `/`, mcp-server `/healthz`, and db-api `/health`. Then loads `datasets.yaml` and verifies each API-served dataset is present in the results-api `/api/v1/datasets` response.
- **BigQuery data coverage** (`bq_summary.py`): Queries BQ views (`credible_sets_v`, `colocalization_v`, `coloc_credsets_v`, `exome_variant_results_v`, `gene_burden_results_v`) for row counts and distinct resources. For credible_sets/exome/gene_based views, compares actual resources against expected from `dataset_to_resource_rules`. For colocalization views, derives expected resources from the results-api's dataset products (coloc pairs). Collection sub-resources (eQTL Catalogue `qtd*`) are collapsed to their parent. API resource names are mapped to BQ resource names via `dataset_to_resource_rules` patterns.
- **Log alerts** (`alerter.py`): Queries Cloud Logging for `severity >= WARNING` entries from `k8s_container` resources in the `genetics` namespace over the last check interval (default 8h). Groups by container, deduplicates via SQLite, and only reports new alerts.

**Deduplication:** The alerter normalizes log messages (stripping timestamps, UUIDs, IPs, request IDs) and hashes `container|normalized_message` into a dedup key. Seen keys are stored in a SQLite database on a PVC (`/data/monitor.db`) with a 24-hour TTL. Expired entries are cleaned up at the start of each run.

**Slack notifications:** Results are formatted as Slack Block Kit messages with deployment flag emoji (Finnish flag for finngen, US flag for daly). When failures or alerts are detected, the configured user is @mentioned for notification. Posted via incoming webhook (`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` from `genetics-secrets`). Human-readable output is also printed to stdout.

**Configuration (env vars):**

| Variable | Source | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `GCP_PROJECT` | CronJob manifest (envsubst) | — | GCP project for BQ and Logging clients |
| `CONFIG_PROFILE` | CronJob manifest (envsubst) | `finngen` | Active dataset profile (also selects flag emoji) |
| `BQ_DATASET` | CronJob manifest (envsubst) | `genetics_results` | BigQuery dataset name |
| `SLACK_ALERT_USER_ID` | CronJob manifest (envsubst); exported by `deploy.sh` from `.env`/shell | — | Slack member ID(s) to @mention on failures; space/comma-separated for multiple users. Kept out of version control (`.env` is gitignored). |
| `DATASETS_CONFIG_PATH` | CronJob manifest | `/app/configs/datasets.yaml` | Path to datasets config |
| `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` | `genetics-secrets` | — | Bearer token for results-api |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | `genetics-secrets` | — | Slack incoming webhook URL |
| `K8S_NAMESPACE` | CronJob manifest | `genetics` | Namespace for log queries |
| `MONITOR_DB_PATH` | CronJob manifest | `/data/monitor.db` | SQLite dedup database path (on PVC) |
| `RESULTS_API_URL` | — | `http://results-api....:4000` | Override results-api URL |
| `ALERT_LOOKBACK_HOURS` | — | `8` | How far back to query logs |
| `ALERT_DEDUP_TTL_HOURS` | — | `24` | How long to suppress duplicate alerts |

**Manual trigger:** `kubectl create job --from=cronjob/monitor monitor-$(date +%s) -n genetics`

**Network policies:** `k8s/network-policies/monitor-policy.yaml` allows the monitor pod (label `app: monitor`) to reach results-api (4000), chat-backend (8000), frontend (3000), mcp-server (8080), and db-api (8080). The service account has `roles/logging.viewer` for Cloud Logging access (configured in `terraform/iam.tf`).

## Security

- Network policies enforce db-api is only reachable from chat-backend, and rag-service only from chat-backend and mcp-server
- Workload Identity provides read-only GCP access (BigQuery + GCS) without key files
- HTTPS enforced via FrontendConfig redirect
- All services output structured JSON logs, captured by GKE fluentbit and sent to Cloud Logging

## Operational procedures

**Important:** `deploy.sh` does NOT build images. To ship new service code you must build first, then deploy. The typical workflow is:

1. `./scripts/build-all.sh` (or `./scripts/build.sh <service>` for one service) — builds and pushes new `:latest` images to Artifact Registry
2. `./scripts/deploy.sh` (or `./scripts/rollout.sh <service>` for one service) — applies manifests and force-restarts pods so they pull the freshly-built `:latest` images

If you only run `deploy.sh` without building, the rollout restart will re-pull whatever `:latest` currently points to in the registry (i.e. the last build), so no code changes from upstream service repos will be picked up.

- **Full deploy**: `./scripts/deploy.sh` — runs terraform apply, configures kubectl, deploys all k8s manifests; derives the container registry from terraform `project_id` (overridable via `REGISTRY` env var) and substitutes it in k8s manifests at deploy time; `CONFIG_PROFILE` (terraform variable, default `daly`) selects the data profile for results-api (`daly` or `finngen`); creates a `datasets-config` ConfigMap from `configs/datasets.yaml` and mounts it into results-api and db-api pods at `/app/configs/datasets.yaml` (env var `DATASETS_CONFIG_PATH`); rag-service is skipped by default (set `ENABLE_RAG=true` to include it); after applying manifests, force-restarts all app deployments so pods pick up `:latest` images and ConfigMap changes (subPath mounts don't propagate; oauth2-proxy doesn't hot-reload). Does **not** build images — run `build-all.sh` or `build.sh` first if you need new code.
- **Branding (product name)**: the displayed product name is configurable per deployment via the `app_name` terraform variable in `terraform.tfvars` (single source of truth; default `FinnGenie`, e.g. `GeneGenie` for the daly profile). Resolution order everywhere is **`APP_NAME` env override → `app_name` in `terraform.tfvars` → `FinnGenie`**. `deploy.sh` reads it from terraform output and injects `APP_NAME` into the chat-backend pod (used by the MCP server's assistant persona in `default_system_prompt`). The frontend bakes it in at build time: `build.sh`/`build-all.sh` resolve `APP_NAME` (grepping `terraform.tfvars` directly, like `deploy.sh` does for `config_profile`) and pass `--build-arg APP_NAME` → Dockerfile writes `VITE_APP_NAME` into `.env` → `import.meta.env.VITE_APP_NAME` (read via `src/config/appName.ts`). So setting `app_name` once in the deployment's tfvars covers both the frontend build and the backend deploy. Logos and the `finngen.fi` CORS/domain identifiers are unchanged.
- **Single service update**: `./scripts/rollout.sh <service> <tag>` — updates one deployment image (requires `REGISTRY` env var)
- **Build all images**: `./scripts/build-all.sh` — builds and pushes all Docker images to Artifact Registry (requires `REGISTRY` env var)
- **Build single image**: `./scripts/build.sh <service>` — clones, builds, and pushes one service's image (requires `REGISTRY` env var; branch overridable via same env vars as build-all.sh)
- **Create secrets**: `./scripts/create-secrets.sh` — creates k8s secrets from environment variables (includes `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for the monitor)
- **Build monitor image**: included in `./scripts/build-all.sh`; builds `scripts/monitor/` as the `monitor` image
- **Deploy monitor**: included in `./scripts/deploy.sh`; applies `k8s/deployments/monitor-cronjob.yaml` with `REGISTRY` envsubst
- **Manual monitor run**: `kubectl create job --from=cronjob/monitor monitor-manual -n genetics`

## Conversation analysis pipeline

The chat backend's conversations are scored for topic, quality and disposition by an LLM-based
analyzer (`analyze_conversations`) whose results are cached in SQLite, refreshed nightly in the
cluster, surfaced to admins in the frontend, and backed up for free alongside the conversations
themselves. The pieces span three repos:

| Piece | Repo | Where |
|-------|------|-------|
| Analyzer + SQLite cache + shared time-series aggregation + admin API | `../genetics-mcp-server` | `scripts/analyze_conversations.py`, `scripts/analysis_timeseries.py`, `db/chat_history_db.py`, `routers/admin.py` |
| Nightly CronJob (this repo) | `genetics-results-suite` | `k8s/deployments/analyze-conversations-cronjob.yaml` |
| Admin UI (Conversations columns + Quality plots) | `../genetics-results-browser` | `src/features/admin/AdminPage.tsx`, `adminApi.ts` |

### SQLite analysis cache

Analysis results persist in two tables inside the same `chat_history.db` SQLite database that
holds the conversations (`conversation_analysis`, keyed by `session_id`, plus a normalized
`conversation_issue` table so issue-category filtering and plots are plain SQL). Storing the
cache in the live DB rather than flat files means it is **persistent and backed up for free**:
`chat_history.db` lives on the `chat-data` PVC, which the existing daily GCE disk snapshot
covers (`terraform/backups.tf`, `google_compute_resource_policy.chat_data_snapshots`, 03:00
daily, `snapshot_retention_days` retention). A restore of that snapshot therefore brings back
the conversations **and** their analysis together, since they share one database file. The
analyzer keeps its write transactions short so the nightly run does not block live chat writes.

The human-readable analysis report stays a flat `.md` file; `metrics.json` and the PNG plots
(`plot_conversation_scores.py`) are local-dev outputs only.

### Nightly CronJob

`k8s/deployments/analyze-conversations-cronjob.yaml` is a CronJob (namespace `genetics`,
schedule `30 2 * * *` — 02:30 daily, a low-traffic window, and just before the 03:00 disk
snapshot so each night's snapshot captures that night's fresh analysis) that keeps every
conversation's analysis up to date. It reuses the existing chat-backend image
(`${REGISTRY}/genetics-mcp-server:latest`) and runs
`python -m genetics_mcp_server.scripts.analyze_conversations --db /data/chat_history.db`.
The analyzer is staleness-based: it only (re)analyzes sessions that are missing, have new
messages (continued conversations, `updated_at > analyzed_at`), or were analyzed by an older
`ANALYZER_VERSION` — unchanged conversations are skipped, so the nightly run only spends LLM
budget on what actually changed. Results are written into the `conversation_analysis`/
`conversation_issue` tables in `chat_history.db`.

- **Storage / RWO co-scheduling**: the job mounts the same `chat-data` PVC at `/data` as
  chat-backend so it reads/writes the same `chat_history.db`. Because that PVC is `ReadWriteOnce`,
  the CronJob uses a `podAffinity requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` rule
  (`labelSelector app: chat-backend`, `topologyKey kubernetes.io/hostname`) to co-schedule on the
  same node as chat-backend so it can attach the volume.
- **Concurrency / scheduling**: `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` (never overlap nightly runs),
  `startingDeadlineSeconds: 3600`, `restartPolicy: OnFailure`, `backoffLimit: 1`,
  `successfulJobsHistoryLimit/failedJobsHistoryLimit: 3`. Resources are modest (the work is
  LLM-bound, mostly waiting on the Anthropic API).
- **Secret**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from `genetics-secrets` (key `anthropic-api-key`), the same
  secret/key chat-backend uses.
- **Deploy**: picked up automatically by `deploy.sh`'s `deployments/*.yaml` loop (`REGISTRY`
  envsubst + `:latest`→tag rewrite); no script change needed.
- **Manual force-reanalyze** (rerun everything from scratch, e.g. after bumping `ANALYZER_VERSION`):
  `kubectl -n genetics create job analyze-conversations-force-$(date +%Y%m%d) --from=cronjob/analyze-conversations -- python -m genetics_mcp_server.scripts.analyze_conversations --db /data/chat_history.db --force`

### Local / dev usage

The analyzer still runs standalone for development (in `../genetics-mcp-server`):
`python -m genetics_mcp_server.scripts.analyze_conversations --db <path>/chat_history.db --output-dir <dir>`.
`--db` points at any copy of the SQLite DB and `--output-dir` collects the local-dev artifacts
(`metrics.json` and, via `plot_conversation_scores.py`, the PNG plots); the analysis report
`.md` is also written there. The same SQLite cache and staleness rules apply locally, so a dev
run only re-analyzes changed sessions unless `--force` is passed. Bumping the `ANALYZER_VERSION`
constant in `analyze_conversations.py` invalidates all cached rows so the next run (local or the
nightly CronJob, with `--force`) re-scores everything.

### Admin UI additions

The admin page in `../genetics-results-browser` (`src/features/admin/AdminPage.tsx`) consumes
the analysis through the chat backend's admin API:

- **Conversations tab** gains 4 analysis-derived columns, each server-side filterable
  (consistent with the existing user/date filters): disposition, issue count (with a tooltip
  listing the issue categories), LLM rating (1-5 or `NA` for unrated), and a
  successful / neutral / unsuccessful icon.
- **Quality plots tab** (added after Feedback) renders 4 interactive Chart.js line charts —
  per-score share, rolling mean + volume, disposition mix, and issue-category mix — that mirror
  the PNG plots. Hovering a line highlights it and dims the others so a single issue category or
  disposition can be followed over time.

These are fed by the chat backend's admin router (`../genetics-mcp-server/routers/admin.py`):
the `/chat/v1/admin/sessions` list LEFT JOINs the analysis fields and accepts the new filter
params (disposition, `min_issues`, success label, rating including `NA`=unrated), and a new
`GET /chat/v1/admin/analytics/quality` endpoint returns raw per-conversation rows that the
frontend aggregates client-side using the same rolling-window logic as `analysis_timeseries.py`,
so the JS and PNG plots cannot drift.

### Backup / restore

No new backup infrastructure is needed: because the analysis tables live in `chat_history.db`
on the `chat-data` PVC, the existing daily disk snapshot (`terraform/backups.tf`) already covers
them. Restoring a `chat-data` snapshot restores the conversations and their cached analysis
together. If analysis was lost or wiped without restoring the disk, re-running the analyzer
(nightly or the manual force job above) regenerates it from the conversations.
